# VKU - Vulkan Utilities

 *This library is primarily maintained by the author [mindrage](https://github.com/mindrage) to for training and learning*

 ## Purpose

 Vulkan Utilities is meant to act as a extendable wrapper that integrates glm types to automatically handle type declarations and so on.

 All examples are in the test directory and provides a single file for each example (*excluding resources*).  

 The idea of the wrapper is to reduce as much code as possible to only have the usability part visible for the user.  
 The api tries to use templates and object inheritance to manage creation and configuration of objects.
